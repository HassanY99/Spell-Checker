# Spell-Checker

 ## Description

  This program is written to correct wrong spelled words and provide the correct word from the dictionary. Given an input, the program should check to see if it exists in a dictionary of correctly spelled words.
  
  This Java code checks for spelling mistakes in a word, sentence or in a file and can provide the best possible correct word that user might be trying to write.
  
  As of now, this program uses 4 important algorithms:
  1) charAppendPrepend():
    This algorithm adds a char if user misses a letter either in the front or back of the word.
  2) charMissingInBetween():
    This algorithm adds a char if user misses a letter in between the word excluding the first and last letter of the word.
  3) removesExtraLetter():
    This algorithm removes a char if users accidentally adds an extra letter at the front, end or in between the word.
  4) swapAdjChar():
    This algorithm swaps char if user accidentally swaps letter in the word e.g. haerd -> heard.
